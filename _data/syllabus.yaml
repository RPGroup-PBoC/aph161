      title: Semantics on scale (18:13)
      description: This vignette describes two ways in which we will use the word scale. First, in the spirit of "what sets the scale of X?" and second, how some quantity of interest, such as the diffusion time, scales with some other quantity such as the length over which that scaling occurs.

      title: Osmotic pressure (14:11)
      description: When there is a concentration difference across a membrane such as a frog's skin, water will flow as a result of osmotic pressure. Here we use simple free energy arguments to explain osmotic pressure.
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThHDJ_sOHxU
      title: Linear transport laws (20:35)
      description: This vignette discusses one of the most powerful tools in the physicochemical arsenal for working out the dynamics of how systems approach the maximum entropy (equilibrium) state.

      titlea: Diffusion - introduction (10:42)
      descriptiona: This vignette introduces diffusion as molecular and cell biology's dynamical null hypothesis. As we will see in subsequent vignettes, like many of the key ideas of physics, there are many different ways to view this subject.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dGGM0v1U9o
      titlea: Diffusion - coin flips (19:15)
      descriptiona: One view of diffusion is as the dynamics that result when independent agents "choose" what they are going to do next by flipping coins. While this observation seems contrived and trivial, it is actually very deep.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olekmCT0i4
      titlea: Diffusion - continuum theory (22:11)
      descriptiona: As with Toner Tu theory, we can write a field theory for diffusion that culminates in the famed partial differential equation known as the diffusion equation. This vignette describes that theory.

      titlea: Diffusion - master equation (17:46)

      title: Positional inforamtion - the French flag model (11:12)
      description: This vignette is a very concrete case study of reaction-diffusion equations as they pertain to anterior-posterior patterning in the fly. Note that part of the fun of taking this model seriously is that we see that it falls quantitatively short of accounting for the experimental data, raising the need to consider further refinements.

      titlea: Statistical mechanics protocol (18:49)

      title: Proton motive force (9:51)
      description: A variety of molecular machines are run by a biological battery known as the proton motive force that has both an entropic contribution and a contribution due to the electrical potential differences across the cell membrane. This vignette gives an elementary description of that biological battery.
    - url: https://youtu.be/xSw-YUAEZbI
      title: The great Gibbs and the chemical potential (24:16)
      description: This vignette describes one of the most important ideas in statistical physics, the chemical potential. We will use this tool for thinking about out of equilibrium dynamics.
    - url: https://youtu.be/OZmx8BKyC8Q
      title: Binding via chemical potential (14:12)
      description: This vignette gives an example of how to use the chemical potential in the context of the statistical mechanics protocol to describe ligand-receptor binding. Note the huge simplification of using Gibbs' brilliant approach compared to the explicit treatment of the solution. One of the single most powerful ideas in all of physics is that of formally and rigorously integrating degrees of freedom out of our treatment.
    - url: https://youtu.be/ohG2Fab8e64
      title: The relaxation to equilibrium (21:31)
      description: This vignette describes the all important topic of how we compute the dynamics of systems as they relax towards equilibrium. We show how the classic linear transport laws are a small perturbation limit of the more general free energy relaxation.
    - url: https://youtu.be/bhQc14lkfG0
      title: Allostery no physicists allowed (8:54)
      description: This vignette is a very brief introduction to the subject of allostery. A noted biologist said that they would not even talk to physicists thinking of working in biology if they could not define allostery. The famed Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model can be thought of as biology's version of the Ising model.
    - url: https://youtu.be/vbuUlVf1lt0
      title: Cashing in concentration gradients symporters (28:17)
      description: This super fun vignette is based upon a beautiful paper of Daniel Zukerman that shows how we can think about the out of equilibrium dynamics using simple ideas about free energy as a driving force. I think of this as a very deep example of how biological fuel can be demystified through careful statistical mechanical reasoning.
    - url: https://youtu.be/IyofGaENESk
      title: "Dynamics of symporter (23:35)"
      description: This vignette continues with the exemplary problem of the symporter to describe the process from a chemical kinetics perspective that explicitly shows how the reaction rates violate detailed balance.

      title: ATP biological battery - phosphorylation-dephosphorylation dynamic>

      title: Phosphorylation energetics (50:37)

      description: This vignette asks the question of how accurate the processes of biological polymerization such as transcription and translation can be if their recognition mechanism is strictly based on equilibrium binding.
    - url: https://youtu.be/dzXFG39UmvI
      title: Why equilibrium? (22:04)
      description: This vignette addresses the equilibrium elephant in the room. One of the most persistent comments that I have met in my time in biophysics is that living systems are not equilibrium and hence we have no right to use equilibrium thinking. This vignette takes a more nuanced view of that question.
    - url: https://youtu.be/bX9rz1SVWpQ
      title: Kinetic proofreading (18:28)
      description: This vignette explores one of the great conceptual ideas of modern molecular biology, namely, kinetic proofreading. We consider a highly schematized view of the phenomenon that illustrates the tradeoffs between speed, energy consumption, and fidelity.
